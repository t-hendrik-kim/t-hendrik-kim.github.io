			  <p>Roughly, I'm a semanticist. I always buy season tickets for games that take place between sentence- and meaning-building operations in natural language. </p>

					<p>I identify myself as a linguist in training with semantics close to my heart. I lost my heart to semantics by virtue of Prof. <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~morzycki/">Marcin Morzycki</a>, who then was my undergrad thesis advisor and later became my MA thesis advisor at <a href="http://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State</a>. I learned that it is seriously addictive to immerse oneself in the world of meaning, and that I wield the intuitive knowledge of Korean, my native language, to make my way through it.</p>
					<p>Any meaning that is expressible in one language can also be expressed in another with adequate effort. How is this possible? Fortunately, all natural languages are structurally similar in most aspects, whether it be English, Chinese, Xhosa, or Tsez. Given the structural similarity, and the basic operations involved in structure building process, e.g. Merge and Move, we expect to find universal principles that dictate the composition of meaning as well. What are such universal meaning composition principles, and how do they interact with the basic structure building operations? This inquiry is challenging as well as interesting, because the proceduce for understanding such universals must be accompanied by isolating the contribution of functional morphemes that vary across languages from that of universal principles in a range of possible interpretations of any given sentence. What are the components that vary systematically across languages? I am interested in linguistic phenomena that may guide us to a closer understanding of the universal principles and systematic variations across languages within the realm of natural language semantics.</p>
					<p>Some of the topics that comprise my interest are topicalization, focalization, nominalization, modification, gradability, head movement, and adjuncts. I am also interested in co-speech iconic gestures, and how semantics constrains gestures.</p>
